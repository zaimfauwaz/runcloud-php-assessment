This is a repository, containing RunCloud Assessment using PHP Language.

This internship assessment uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, inclusive of both class-object and inheritance (using abstract).


**How to Execute the Codes**
1. Ensure that your system has php installed. If php is not yet installed, then you can install it using *sudo apt install php*.
2. After php is installed, please install composer into your system (required for *composer dump-autoload*).
3. Download the files from this repo in ZIP format, and extract them into a folder.
4. The folder can be copied/moved into /var/www/html/ (or similar folder structure).
5. Before executing the PHP file, run *composer dump-autoload* first (ensure the terminal directory is in the location, where composer.json is available).
6. To execute the file, run command *php runcloud.php* in the terminal.


**Note: The codes are executed and tested using the actual Linux VPS (Ubuntu 24.04 latest).**
